My Data Structure project is a shortest path finder that uses the Dijkstra algorithm. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input a graph of nodes and edges, and then calculates the shortest path between two nodes using the Dijkstra algorithm. The project also visualizes the calculated path on the graph.The user interface is designed using HTML and CSS, while the logic and algorithm are implemented using JavaScript. The project aims to showcase the use of data structures and algorithms in solving real-world problems.
